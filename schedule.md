### Endnotes
  
<ol>
<li>Considering personal testing and what was discovered about the limited number of groups suggestions, particularly the immediate suggestions, it is possible that the DFS and BFS searches will be limited to pages suggestions. If this occurs, the analysis of groups suggestions may be dropped if no alternatives are found due to the finiteness of the search space.</li>
<li>If no alternatives are found for studying the group suggestions algorithm, there may be no data collection for groups.</li>
</ol>
