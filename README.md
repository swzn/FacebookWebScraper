# Analysis of algorithms: Facebook 

As part of [Professor Joseph Vybihal](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jvybihal/index.php)'s Prometheus Research Laboratory and McGill University's Honours Computer Science 400 Class, this will be the first submission covering the efforts of Sajad Wazin in the analysis of Facebook's suggestions algorithm. The main focus of this research will be to develop an application that can easily scrape data on Facebook. In particular, the data that will be scraped will be used to research the siloing effect of the algorithm and the types of pages that it recommends to its users. 

This submission contains the development plan for the application, along with mockups of its expected end result. The features of the application are thoroughly discussed and justified. Similarly, the plan for analyzing the data is disclosed in this submission.

## Motivation
- Creating an easy-to-use and flexible application that allows independent researchers to scrape data on Facebook
- Providing a research plan to examine the efficiency of the application in the context of the suggestion algorithm
- Providing a repeatable methodology to independent researchers

<li>Given time limitations, the projected development plan and analysis of data may change. The deliverable schedule will change accordingly. The justification for this is that all of these libraries are new to me, and some of these subjects (particularly automation and NLP) are subjects I have never studied before. These plans and deliverable schedules were made using a realistic mindset, however are open to modifications.</li>
<li>This research is an extension of Prof. Vybihal and Mika Desblancs's research on Facebook. The latter is documented <a href="https://github.com/mika-jpd/YouTube_Radicalization_Recommendations">here</a> and the findings of which will be published in the book "AI & Society: Tensions and Opportunities". It is important to note that a lot of inspiration for this research comes from Prof Vybihal and Mika's work.</li>
