# FacebookWebScraper
This automated applet will allow the user to scrape relevant data by searching through a curated list of Facebook pages or groups. This applet will be interactive and highly customizable to allow the user to select what type of information needs to be collected. In particular, it can be deployed in command-line (terminal) mode, which allows for a Batch-sequential architecture style of automation. It can also be deployed in GUI mode, which is more convenient for the user.

# Content Scraper
On Facebook Pages and Groups, users can make posts that are visible to page followers, group members but also the public in some cases. The content scraper will have the options to save a selected amount of posts on the page (starting from the most recent). 
The information that can be gathered from theses posts are: 
- the content of post
- the reactions to the post
- the comments on the post
- the shares

Future versions of the applet may have the ability to verify if the users who have interacted with the post are followers of the page, members of the group or simply Facebook users who have been reached by the post for some extraneous reason. As such, this feature is extremely useful for research purposes as it allows to see how much reach a group or a page has. It also allows to see how likely it is for a group member or a pager follower to interact with the posts. In the field of research, this feature could be paired with [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) to gauge how much the members of a group or page followers agree/disagree with the posts.
